## Did you use the same type of route to update patient information as to update an employeeâ€™s department?
No for update a patient y used the Put route because it updates the whole patient or multiple values while patch was used for changing the department because it only changes one value.

## Why did you choose the selected strategy?

In this particular case this strategy was more efficient given my use.

## What are the advantages and disadvantages of the strategies you chose for creating these routes?

The routes are designed with a specific purpose depending on the necesary values needed to get, change or delete.

## What is the cost-benefit between using PUT and PATCH?

Patch is more efficient given that uses less bandwith than put.
